Ayayayayayayayaya, Bambam
Black sheep forever, black sheep for life
Izgaaju 'til we kpeme, Antiworld gangsters
Ge records, you get me? Odumodublvck (WeMaMgobhozi)
NATIVE
(He unyana wam, helele-) you go see say my baby bambam
Baddest
Yeah
Shekpe
Obo, Baddest, Chee (WeMaMgobhozi) 

Okay (okay), girl, make I show you my bank account
Two face, I get plenty to go around
So, girl, make you dance when you hear the sound
Na we dey pop all over town
So tell me if you dey down, dey town
Do you know, do you know, say owó mi ti po l'agbo? (Vul' indlela)
Girl, I know, girl, I know, some things that you do not know
Whether na traffic abi go-slow
Baby, I promise I go still show (WeMaMgobhozi)
Spending money Pablo (hey ah) 

I suppose relocate but I go buy Belgium
My money na alele, I apply pressure
Wednesday na your shima palava put us for high tension
You must apply OT
Big boy you must to buy plenty (yeah) 

Even if they wanna stop me
Mismanage my funds on you
All I wanna do is
Mismanage my funds

Alright, okay
Ten brokoto for the voltage
Tilapia, kote, bring egufe with cocain
Gobe, Ucee the gbedu na replay
Find abacha for my brosay
Conquer the street with play play (helele-) 

Anyị je bili na Paris, ọ ga-adị kwa mma
If I handle this your body, oga sọ kwú so, oga sọ kwú sọ
If you put me for palava, m je kpọla gi ọfala
Nwoke na-eme, nwa bu ife, ego na-ebe hmm (WeMaMgobhozi)
I no fit complain you go see say my baby bambam (he unyana wam, helele-)
Ah, baby

I suppose relocate but I go buy Belgium (baby o)
My money na alele, I apply pressure (alele o)
Wednesday na your shima palava put us for high tension
You must apply OT
Big boy you must to buy plenty

Mismanage my funds on you
All I really wanna do is
I'll mismanage my funds
Even if they wanna stop me
Mismanage my funds on you
All I wanna do is
Mismanage my funds on you
All I really wanna do is
I'll mismanage my funds
Even if they wanna stop me
Mismanage my funds on you
Spend all of my funds on you
My baby bambam
